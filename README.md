# Aegis

A handy wrapper for AWS Athena Ruby SDK.

>*...and among them went bright-eyed Athene, holding the precious aegis which is ageless and immortal:
> a hundred tassels of pure gold hang fluttering from it, tight-woven each of them,
> and each the worth of a hundred oxen. (Homer, The Iliad)*

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
